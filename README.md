# python
My python learning journey. I work on code and save here 
this code is able to find any file named 'Product Key' and has file format as TXT 
also copy the data (FORMAT: file data \t file path) and save into another file (PATH : SECOND LOCAL DRIVE / rrs / rrs.txt)
Also able to change/modify search type by editing code variable 'ff'
Also able to change/modify search file type by editing LINE: 26 | for file in glob.glob("**/*.txt", recursive = True):
Also able to send previously created file to FTP server
